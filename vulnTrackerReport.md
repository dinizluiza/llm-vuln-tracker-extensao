## 1. numpy

### 1.1 Known Vulnerabilities

**CVE-2017-12852**  
- **Description**: The `numpy.pad` function has a DoS vulnerability due to missing input validation for zero-length lists/arrays, resulting in infinite loops.
- **Severity**: Medium

**CVE-2014-1858/CVE-2014-1859**  
- **Description**: Temporary files created by numpy are not securely handled and can be targeted by symlink attacksâ€”allowing local privilege escalation or file overwrite.
- **Severity**: Medium

**CVE-2019-6446**  
- **Description**: `numpy.load` used unsafely can allow remote code execution if attackers can submit malicious pickle files.
- **Note**: Upstream challenged the relevance as pickle usage implies trusted sources.
- **Severity**: High

**CVE-2021-33430**  
- **Description**: Buffer overflow in the PyArray_NewFromDescr_int function when specifying large dimensions from Python code.
- **Note**: Upstream marks this as not a vulnerability due to the requirement of privileged access.
- **Severity**: Medium

**CVE-2021-34141**  
- **Description**: Incomplete string comparison in `numpy.core` allows the triggering of incorrect memory copying due to a crafted string object.
- **Note**: Vendor states behavior is likely harmless.
- **Severity**: Medium

**CVE-2021-41495**  
- **Description**: Potential null pointer dereference in `numpy.sort` causes DoS by repeated creation of specific sort arrays.
- **Note**: Practically limited to memory exhaustion.
- **Severity**: Medium

**CVE-2021-41496**  
- **Description**: Buffer overflow in `array_from_pyobj` due to improper handling of negative dimensions.
- **Severity**: Medium

**CVE-2022-29216**  
- **Description**: Tensorflow's `saved_model_cli` tool can allow code injection, when parsing arguments originally for NumPy objects.

- **Description**: DoS in TensorFlow via `numpy` arrays with a certain shape.
- **Severity**: Medium

**CVE-2024-34072**  
- **Description**:  `NumpyDeserializer` in sagemaker-python-sdk before 2.218.0 allows unsafe deserialization, which may lead to remote code execution.
- **Severity**: High

**CVE-2024-34997**  
- **Description**: `joblib` allows deserialization of objects using Numpy, leading to code execution (disputed by supplier).
- **Severity**: High (exploitability depends on usage)

**CVE-2024-11039**  
- **Description**: Pickle deserialization vulnerability due to numpy in the whitelist in binary-husky/gpt_academic, leading to code execution.
- **Severity**: High

### 1.2 Remediation & Recommendations

- **Upgrade numpy to the latest version** (>=1.22, as many CVEs are patched in later releases).
- **Never use untrusted pickle files** (pickle is *not* safe for untrusted input).
- For applications that utilize `numpy.load()`, always use `allow_pickle=False` unless explicitly needed.
- Restrict access to the underlying filesystem and avoid exposing temporary directories if possible.
- When using libraries or tools built on numpy (TensorFlow, sagemaker, joblib, etc.), ensure these are also up to date and review their serialization logic.
- For applications that load numpy objects from external-facing APIs or user uploads, implement *stringent input validation* and consider quarantining or scanning files before use.

- **Disable or restrict rare or unsafe image formats** (e.g., EPS, FLI, TGA, Fpx, SGI, etc.) unless business needs require them.
- **Avoid allowing direct user submission of expressions evaluated through `ImageMath.eval` or similar eval-based APIs.**
- If user-uploaded images are required:
  - Scan them with file type and antivirus tools prior to processing.
  - Set memory limits on image processing.
  - Consider running image processing in a separate, locked-down process/container.
- **Never run Pillow as root** (unless absolutely mandatory).

### 3.2 Remediation & Recommendations

- **NEVER render untrusted templates directly.** Always use a sandboxed environment if there's any possibility of handling untrusted input.
- Always sanitize, validate, and whitelist template variables/values that are rendered through Jinja2.
- **Use the latest supported version** of Jinja2 and any projects/libraries that depend on it.
- Explicitly enable autoescaping and sanitize output.
- Avoid allowing arbitrary strings or user input to flow into template expressions, especially if the user can guess variable names, function names, or inject code.
- If using other frameworks that provide "custom markdown" or "template" features, ensure that they do not use Jinja2 or a similar engine in a way that allows users to enter unsafe code.
- **Mitigate past vulnerabilities** by reviewing your codebase for any use of `from_string`, direct calls to `Template` with unsanitized data, or tools that allow custom user templates.

## 4. summary of dependencies NOT found in CVE dataset

**contourpy**  
- No known CVEs as of this report.  
- **Recommendation:** Keep the library up to date and continue routine security monitoring.

---

## 5. General Security Recommendations

- **Keep all dependencies updated:** Many security vulnerabilities in python libraries are fixed quickly once discovered.
- **Implement input validation:** Never trust user data.
- **Run applications with least privilege:** Run as unprivileged users, minimize file permissions, and avoid running as root.
- **Isolate and containerize:** Where possible, restrict what files/code can be accessed.
- **Vulnerability scanning and monitoring:** Use tools like `bandit`, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot for ongoing reviews.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)/Reverse proxy:** To help catch some attacks before they reach the application level.

---

## 6. Remediation Plan

- **Upgrade Numpy, Pillow, and Jinja2 to their latest maintained versions.**
- **Patch or upgrade impacted applications and libraries that use these dependencies, especially those exposing pickle, image load, or template APIs to untrusted users.**
- **Never use 'pickle' loading from untrusted sources, and avoid using allow_pickle=True in numpy.load.**
- **Sanitize all user input prior to rendering by Jinja2, and enable/require sandboxed environments for any user-controlled template logic.**
- **Block and monitor suspicious requests at the container, application, and network level. Limit open file descriptors, disk/memory usage, and monitor for infinite loops or excessive resource consumption.**
- **Review and limit the use of rare or dangerous image formats in Pillow, such as EPS, PCX, SGI, JP2K, etc., especially for user-uploaded files.**
- **Test your application with security scanning tools and conduct a security review after upgrades.**

---

## 7. Conclusion

The scanned dependencies contain several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities that can allow remote code execution, denial of service, privilege escalation, and information disclosureâ€”especially for applications that process untrusted data or provide APIs for image/array/template processing to users.

**Immediate upgrades and code reviews are required** to ensure your application's security posture is maintained. Continuous monitoring and secure coding practices must be followed to avoid reintroducing similar vulnerabilities. For the most critical areas (user upload, dynamic templates, untrusted file processing), consider additional isolation and security controls.
